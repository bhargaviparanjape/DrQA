These files are the dependencies for the Codalab MatchLSTM runs.
Small modifications to the original code were made to support AddAny and AddWords,
as these require access to the output distribution.
The original code is also released [on github](https://github.com/shuohangwang/SeqMatchSeq),
with the associated license found in `LICENSE.txt`.
